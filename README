This directory contains a partial Common Lisp standards compliance
test suite.

To run the tests, load gclload.lsp.  This will load and
run the tests.  To just load the tests, load gclload1.lsp
and gclload2.lsp.

Individual tests may be run by (rt:do-test '<test name>).

Please tell me when you find incorrect test cases.

--------------------------------

(30 Jun 2003) I've decided to add metainformation to the tests,
in the form of :<attribute> <value> pairs after DEFTEST.  Also,
I've added a DEFNOTE form to define note objects whose names
can be attached to properties of tests, to enable selective
disabling of classes of tests.
