This directory contains a partial Common Lisp standards compliance
test suite.

To load, edit load.lsp and load it.  To run, do this:

	(in-package :cl-test)
	(do-tests)

From GCL, instead just load gclload.lsp.  This will automatically
run the tests.

Individual tests may be run by (do-test '<test name>).

The tests here cover the CONSes, SYMBOLs and PACKAGEs section of the
hyperspec, as well as fragments of other parts (sequences, types,
lists, arrays, structures, the reader).  I intend to add tests for the
other parts of the standard.  The package tests are currently disabled
in GCL because of a bug in DEFPACKAGE.

When I run this I have a copy of the MK defsystem in the ../defsys30
directory.  The .system files use the MK forms (not the defsystem from
ACL).  (Note: when gclload.lsp is loaded the defsystem is not used.)

The tar file contains a modified version of the Waters RT regression
test package, which gets installed in subdirectory rt/.

Please tell me when you find incorrect test cases.

There are five test cases that cause very long loops on ACL (ELT-*
tests on type-bogus inputs; I think the system is considering the
pointers to be very large unsigned integers.)
